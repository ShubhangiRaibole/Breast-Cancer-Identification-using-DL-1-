The objective of this dissertation is to explore various deep learning techniques that can be used to implement a system which learns how to detect instances of breast cancer in mammograms. Nowadays, breast cancer claims 11,400 lives on average every year in the UK, making it one of the deadliest diseases. Mammography is the gold standard for detecting early signs of breast cancer, which can help cure the disease during its early stages. However, incorrect mammography diagnoses are common and may harm patients through unnecessary treatments and operations (or a lack of treatments). Therefore, systems that can learn to detect breast cancer on their own could help reduce the number of incorrect interpretations and missed cases.
